## 88 Cannot connect Windows Admin Center to Azure when creating a new Azure App ID
If you're unable to connect Windows Admin Center to Azure because you can't automatically create and use an Azure App ID on the gateway, create an Azure App ID and assign it the right permissions on the portal. Then, select **Use existing in the gateway**. For more information, visit [connecting your gateway to Azure.](/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/azure/azure-integration).
