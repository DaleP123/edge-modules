## 56 Error occurs when running Uninstall-AksHci and AKS on Azure Stack HCI is not installed
If you run [Uninstall-AksHci](./reference/ps/./uninstall-akshci.md) when AKS on Azure Stack HCI is not installed, you'll receive the error message: _Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Path' because it is null_. You can safely ignore the error message as there is no functional impact.
