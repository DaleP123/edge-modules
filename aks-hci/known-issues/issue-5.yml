  ## 5 Error: `Timed out waiting for the condition`

This error usually points to one of the following issues:

- The clusters were created in an Azure VM in a virtualized environment, or if you're deploying AKS on Azure Stack HCI on multiple levels of virtualization. 
- Due to a slow internet.

If one of the above scenarios applies to you, run [Disable-AksHciArcConnection](./reference/ps/disable-akshciarcconnection.md) and try connecting again. If the above scenario doesn't apply to you,  [open a support issue](./help-support.md) on AKS on Azure Stack HCI.
