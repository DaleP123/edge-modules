## 55 Uninstall-AksHCI is not cleaning up cluster resources (`ownergroup ca-<GUID>`)
Due to insufficient permissions in Active Directory, [Uninstall-AksHci](./reference/ps/uninstall-akshci.md) could not remove cluster resource objects in Active Directory, which can lead to failures in subsequent deployments. To fix this issue, ensure that the user performing the installation has Full Control permissions to create/modify/remove Active Directory objects in the Active Directory container that the server and service objects are created in.
