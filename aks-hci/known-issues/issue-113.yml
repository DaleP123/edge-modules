## 113 New-AksHciCluster times out when creating an AKS cluster with 200 nodes 
The deployment of a large cluster may time out after two hours, however, this is a static time-out. You can ignore this time out occurrence as the operation is running in the background. Use the `kubectl get nodes` command to access your cluster and monitor the progress.
