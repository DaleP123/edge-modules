## 119 When running Get-AksHciCluster, a `release version not found` error occurs
When running [Get-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/get-akshcicluster.md) to verify the status of an AKS on Azure Stack HCI installation in Windows Admin Center, the output shows an error: `A release with version 1.0.3.10818 was NOT FOUND`. However, when running [Get-AksHciVersion](./reference/ps/get-akshciversion.md), it showed the same version was installed. This error indicates that the build is expired. To resolve this issue, run `Uninstall-AksHci`, and then run a new AKS on Azure Stack HCI build.
