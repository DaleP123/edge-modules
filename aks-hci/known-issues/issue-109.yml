## 109 When using kubectl to delete a node, the associated VM might not be deleted

You'll see this issue if you follow these steps:

1. Create a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Scale the cluster to more than two nodes.
3. Delete a node by running the following command: 
   ```powershell
   kubectl delete node <node-name>
   ```

4. Return a list of the nodes by running the following command:
   ```powershell
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
   The removed node isn't listed in the output.
5. Open a PowerShell with administrative privileges and run the following command:
   ```powershell
   get-vm
   ```
The removed node is still listed.

This failure causes the system not to recognize that the node is missing, and therefore, a new node won't spin up.
