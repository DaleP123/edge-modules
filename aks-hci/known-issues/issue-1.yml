  ## 1 Error: `Error while updating agents for enabling features`

If you enable the *custom location* and *cluster connect* features on your Azure Arc connected AKS on Azure Stack HCI cluster, you may see the following error: 

`Error while updating agents for enabling features. Please run "kubectl get pods -n azure-arc" to check the pods in case of timeout error. Error: Error: UPGRADE FAILED: timed out waiting for the condition`

This is a known issue with the September release and is fixed in the October release. New AKS on Azure Stack HCI clusters created using the October release and connected to Arc using [Enable-AksHciArcConnection](./reference/ps/enable-akshciarcconnection.md) do not experience this issue. Update your AKS on Azure Stack HCI deployment to the October release and then reconnect your existing clusters to Arc for a workaround to this issue.
