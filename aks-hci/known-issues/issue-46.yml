## 46 Delete KVA certificate if expired after 60 days

KVA certificate expires after 60 day if no upgrade is performed.

`Update-AksHci` and any command involving `kvactl` will throw the following error.

`Error: failed to get new provider: failed to create azurestackhci session: Certificate has expired: Expired`

To resolve this error, delete the expired certificate file at `\kvactl\cloudconfig` and try `Update-AksHci` again on the node seeing the certificate expiry issue. You can use the following command:

```bash
$env:UserProfile.wssd\kvactl\cloudconfig
```
