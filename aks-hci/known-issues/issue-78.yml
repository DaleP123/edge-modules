## 78 Access is denied

In Stage 2.1: Basic Step Component, you may encounter this error: `Connecting to remote server *** failed with the following error message : Access is denied. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.` when trying to use your credentials for your server node(s).
Please first make sure that the account/credentials added is an administrative account on the machine. Then verify that PSRemoting is enabled and remote hosts are trusted. You can do this with the following PowerShell commands:
```powershell-interactive
Enable-PSRemoting -Force 
winrm quickconfig 
```

If you are still encountering issues, please follow this [troubleshooting guide](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_remote_troubleshooting?view=powershell-7.2).
