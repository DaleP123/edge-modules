## 104 ContainerD is unable to pull the pause image as _kubelet_ mistakenly collects the image 

When _kubelet_ is under disk pressure, it collects unused container images, which may include pause images, and when this happens, ContainerD canâ€™t pull the image. 

Currently, AKS on Azure Stack HCI uses Azure Container Registry (ACR) only with authentication disabled as a workaround for an ACR bug. Therefore, the same credentials shipped to customers could be used to pull the pause images on affected nodes, for example, username: 1516df5a-f1cc-4a6a-856c-03d127b02d05, password: 92684690-48b5-4dce-856d-ef4cccb54f22.

To resolve this issue, run the following steps:

1. Connect to the affected node using SSH and run the following command:

   ```
   sudo su
   ```

2. To pull the image, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   crictl pull --creds aaa:bbb ecpacr.azurecr.io/pause:3.2
   ```
