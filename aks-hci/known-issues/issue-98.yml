  ## 98 Running an upgrade results in the error: `Error occurred while fetching platform upgrade information`

When running an upgrade in Windows Admin Center, the following error occurred:

`Error occurred while fetching platform upgrade information. RemoteException: No match was found for the specified search criteria and module name 'AksHci'. Try Get-PSRepository to see all available registered module repositories.`

This error message typically occurs when AKS on Azure Stack HCI is deployed in an environment that has a proxy configured. Currently, Windows Admin Center does not have support to install modules in a proxy environment. To resolve this error, set up AKS on Azure Stack HCI [using the proxy PowerShell command](set-proxy-settings.md).
