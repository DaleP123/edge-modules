## 107 Attempt to create new workload clusters failed because the AKS host was turned off for several days
An AKS on Azure Stack HCI cluster deployed in an Azure VM was previously working fine, but after the AKS host was turned off for several days, the `Kubectl` command didn't work. After running either the `Kubectl get nodes` or `Kubectl get services` command, this error message appeared: `Error from server (InternalError): an error on the server ("") has prevented the request from succeeding`.

This issue occurred because the AKS host was turned off for longer than four days, which caused the certificates to expire. Certificates are frequently rotated in a four-day cycle. Run [Repair-AksHciClusterCerts](./reference/ps/repair-akshciclustercerts.md) to fix the certificate expiration issue.
