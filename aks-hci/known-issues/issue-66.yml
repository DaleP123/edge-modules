## 66 During an upgrade, custom node taints, roles, and labels are lost

When upgrading, you may lose all custom taints, roles, and labels that you added to your worker nodes. Since AKS on Azure Stack HCI is a managed service, adding custom taints, labels, and roles when performed outside the provided PowerShell cmdlets or Windows Admin Center is not supported.

To work around this issue, run the [New-AksHciNodePool](./reference/ps/new-akshcinodepool.md) cmdlet to correctly [create a node pool with taints](./reference/ps/new-akshcinodepool.md#create-a-node-pool-with-taints) for your worker nodes.
