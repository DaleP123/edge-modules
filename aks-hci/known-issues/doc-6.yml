# Resolve errors when enabling or disabling Azure Arc on your AKS workload clusters

This article describes errors you may encounter (and their workarounds) while connecting or disconnecting your AKS on Azure Stack HCI workload clusters to Azure Arc using the PowerShell cmdlets [Enable-AksHciArcConnection](./reference/ps/enable-akshciarcconnection.md) and [Disable-AksHciArcConnection](./reference/ps/disable-akshciarcconnection.md). For issues that are not covered in this article, see [troubleshooting Arc enabled Kubernetes](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/troubleshooting).

You can also [open a support issue](./help-support.md) if none of the workarounds listed below apply to you.
