  ## 9 Error: `Cluster addons arc uninstall Error: namespaces "azure-arc" not found`

This error usually means that you have already uninstalled Arc agents from your workload cluster, or you have manually deleted the `azure-arc` namespace using the `kubectl` command. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to confirm that you do not have any leaked resources. For example, verify that you do not see a `connectedCluster` resource in the subscription and resource group.
