## 92 On Windows Admin Center, the message `error occurred while creating service principal` appears while installing an AKS host on Azure Stack HCI
You will get this error if you have disabled pop-ups. Google Chrome blocks pop-ups by default, and therefore, the Azure sign-in pop-up is blocked and causes the service principal error.
