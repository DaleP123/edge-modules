## 10 Error: `Secrets "sh.helm.release.v1.azure-arc.v1" not found`

This error indicates that your Kubernetes API server could not be reached. Try running the [Disable-AksHciArcConnection](./reference/ps/disable-akshciarcconnection.md) command again, and then go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to confirm that your `connectedCluster` resource has actually been deleted. You can also run `kubectl get ns -a` to confirm that the namespace, `azure-arc`, does not exist on your cluster.
