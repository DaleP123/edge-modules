## 76 `Install-Module` was not recognized

In stage 2.1: System Validation, you may get an error: `The item 'Install-Module' was not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or runnable program. Please check the spelling of the name, if the path is included, make sure the path is correct and try again` when you install. For the PowerShell commands, please complete them on the node(s) that you are trying to deploy to. Please run the following command (ensure your PowerShell version is at least 5.1) to resolve:
```powershell-interactive
Install-Module -Name PowershellGet -Repository PSGallery -Force -Confirm:$false -SkipPublisherCheck
```

Then run these commands if you encounter any errors from the first command: 
```powershell-interactive
Get-PSRepository
Register-PSRepository -Default
```
