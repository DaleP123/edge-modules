  ## 7 Error: `A workload cluster with the name 'my-aks-cluster' was not found`

This error means that you have not created the workload cluster, or you have incorrectly spelled the name of the workload cluster. Run [Get-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/get-akshcicluster.md) to confirm you have the correct name or that the cluster you want to connect to Arc exists.
