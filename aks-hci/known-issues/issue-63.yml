## 63 When upgrading a Kubernetes cluster with an Open Policy Agent, the upgrade process hangs

When upgrading Kubernetes clusters with an Open Policy Agent (OPA), such as OPA GateKeeper, the process may hang and unable to complete. This issue can occur because the policy agent is configured to prevent pulling container images from private registries.

To resolve this issue, if you upgrade clusters deployed with an OPA, make sure that your policies allow for pulling images from Azure Container Registry. For an AKS on Azure Stack HCI upgrade, you should add the following endpoint in your policy's list: _ecpacr.azurecr.io_.
