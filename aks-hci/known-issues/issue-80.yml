## 80 Restarting Azure Stack HCI nodes causes timing issue
Restarting the Azure Stack HCI cluster nodes hosting the management cluster and workload clusters may cause the workload clusters to disappear from the WAC dashboard. To work around this issue, pause and drain the nodes before you plan to restart them. Sometimes, the workload clusters may just take longer to appear in the dashboard.
